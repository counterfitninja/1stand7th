We encourage our young people to do more, learn more and be more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week, we provide young people the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future. We\u2019re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience \u2013 skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance, always. We\u2019re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2023 we will have prepared more young people with skills for life, supported by amazing leaders delivering an inspiring programme. We will be growing, more inclusive, shaped by young people and making a bigger impact in our communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are proud to say we are a values-based movement. Our Scout values of integrity, respect, care, belief and cooperation guide everything we do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scouts prepare young people for Skills For Life<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week Scouts gives almost half a million people aged 6-25 the skills they need for school, college, university, the job interview, the important speech, the tricky challenge and the big dreams: the skills they need for life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience &amp; skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone\u2019s welcome here. All genders, races and backgrounds. Regardless of your child\u2019s physical ability \u2013 there\u2019s a Scout adventure out there waiting for them. And we\u2019ll help them find it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do Scouts do?<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling, cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week \u2013 having fun, playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, from helping out occasionally on a parent rota or volunteering your time as a leader to supporting local Scouting. Our volunteering opportunities are as varied as you! Because whether you\u2019re helping a leader to run an activity in the local village hall, organising a night away, or buttering 120 slices of bread for a group of very hungry eleven year olds \u2013 no two Scout meetings are the same. The difference you make, though, is always great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At 1st &amp; 7th Frome Jubilee Scout Group, we believe in preparing young people with skills for life.
