<p><strong>Going on adventures</strong></p>
<p>Race down a river. Tell stories by torchlight. Fall asleep beneath the stars. Alongside your Pack, you’ll spend plenty of time in the great outdoors. Together, you might build a den in your local park, or create an edible raft out of sweets, or go on a moonlit hike through your hometown.</p>
<p><strong>Learning new skills</strong></p>
<p>Cubs learn by doing, and so will you. Some of the skills you develop will be practical, like knowing how to cook a delicious meal or give someone first aid.</p>
<p><strong>Helping others</strong></p>
<p>Cubs work as a team to help other people. Together, you’ll learn about global issues and what we can all do to help solve them.</p>
