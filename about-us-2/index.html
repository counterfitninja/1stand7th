skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</p><p>Everyone’s welcome here. All genders, races and backgrounds. Regardless of your child’s physical ability – there’s a Scout adventure out there waiting for them. And we’ll help them find it.</p><p>We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</p><h4>What do Scouts do?</h4><p>Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling, cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week – having fun, playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.</p><h4>Volunteers</h4><p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, from helping out occasionally on a parent rota or volunteering your time as a leader to supporting local Scouting. Our volunteering opportunities are as varied as you! Because whether you’re helping a leader to run an activity in the local village hall, organising a night away, or buttering 120 slices of bread for a group of very hungry eleven year olds - no two Scout meetings are the same. The difference you make, though, is always great.</p><p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://www.1stand7thfromescouts.org.uk/"><img src="https://www.1stand7thfromescouts.org.uk/media/website/276167669_367073238797212_5856046896101117340_n.png" alt="1st and 7th Frome Scouts" width="300" height="121"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-left">1st and 7th Frome (Jubilee) Scout Group</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
