We will minimise the use of paper to only what is required for the event\/camp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We will ensure:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transfer of paper is secure, such as physical hand to hand transfer or registered post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper forms are securely destroyed after use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secure destruction will be through a shredding machine or securely burned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always keeping the paper records secure, especially when in transit, by using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lockable briefcase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lockable filing cabinet if long term stored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If transferred to somebody, we will audit that they return them when the event is complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awards<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we may nominate a member for national award, (such as King\u2019s Scout or Duke of Edinburgh award), such nominations would require we provide contact details to the awarding organisation, this is most often done on paper via registered post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Secure computer systems<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it is necessary for us to store or use data in computers, laptops, phones or tablets.
