            "content_html": "<p>NMC TOP 100 SCOUT GAMES<br>Hi All<br>My name is Jimmy Cunningham and I'm a member of the NMC and also Provincial Commissioner for the North <br>East Province. I think that the Centenary Badge and the Procedure for achieving this gives great scope for <br>exploring various new programme ideas for our groups. As you knew the criteria for achieving the 2nd part of <br>this Badge meant completing a task to organize a programme item that includes the number 100.<br>As a member of the NMC I felt it was important that we as a group took a lead in this. So I took on the <br>challenge of compiling this games book which I hope will be of great use to all Section leaders in the country.<br>I hope this book will give all leaders in all sections a resource of games for their Meetings and Camps. <br>The original idea I had was to compile 100 games with each of the 20 members of NMC contributing 5 games <br>each. But as I couldn’t achieve this I opened it up to all groups in the country and got some but not a lot of <br>replies. I made my target of 100 games.<br>I have also added an extra 219 games book of my own to the back which divides games into different <br>categories for ease of use. I want to thank Vincent Burns and Declan Reilly for their help in compiling this book.  <br>I want to thank all the people that took time out to email me their games and I have included them in the book <br>with an acknowledgement that it was their selection.<br>With a total of 319 games in the book If you just used 2 of these games each time you had a meeting you would <br>be fit to run 5 years worth of games without using the same game twice.<br>This book is not complete it’s only the start of your own group personal games book so each time to play a new <br>game record it and put it into the book so you can build up a further library of games.<br>This book will be published on the scouting Ireland website and can be easily downloaded and added to.<br>Hope you enjoy this book and find it of some use as you proceed along the scouting trail<br>Jimmy Cunningham<br>20th August 2008<br>NMC TOP 100 SCOUT GAMES<br>Jimmy Cunningham Selection<br>1.Spud:<br>Every scout is given a different ‘secret’ number, leader throws ball in the air and shouts a <br>number (scouts are in a circle). As soon as ball is in the air, everyone runs away. Whichever scouts <br>number is called runs to catch the ball, when they have caught it everyone else must stand still, the <br>scout with the ball then throws it at someone who is then ‘on’ and ‘out’.<br>2.Number Game:<br>Leader calls a number, say 5, scouts must get into groups of 5. Odd scouts left are out, continue until <br>only one left.<br>3.Cambridge and Oxford the Boat Race:<br>Teams sit on the floor in ‘rock the boat’ style. They hold on to the person behind at the ankles (person <br>at end holds onto shoulders). Each team must race (shuffling) to the end of the hall then turn around <br>and race again.<br>4.Wink/tongue Murderer:<br>All beavers are in a circle , a detective is outside ( 1 beaver). A murderer is chosen and then the <br>detective comes back in and has to figure out who the murderer is. The murderer kills people by <br>winking at them or sticking their tongue out until the detective figures out who the murderer is.<br>5.Jimmy’s Happy Game:<br>Skittle relay is where all patrols are lined up in formation one behind each other. On the whistle the <br>first person in the patrol is given a ball/log . They have to try and knock down a skittle at the other <br>side of the room and keep trying until they do. When they knock it they have to run up stand it back <br>up and then proceed to hand the baton on to the next member of the patrol. The winners are the first <br>patrol to finish.<br>Michael Devin’s Selection<br>6.Smiles<br>Beaver/Cubs/Scouts form a circle all hold straight faces the leader throws his smile to one of group <br>that person has to smile and pass it on however when he passes it on he/she must keep a straight <br>face. If you smile while not holding the smile your out.<br>7. Emergency<br>All the section remove their shoes you place all shoes in the middle of floor get the section into a <br>circle turn off the lights and give them 3 mins to find their own shoes first lodge six or patrol with all <br>shoes on and tied in a straight line are the winner<br>8. Kings<br>Split the section into two remove all shoes and ask each group to select a king. Place each king on a <br>chair at each end of the hall. Each group have to try and get up to the other end of the hall and <br>capture the other side’s king. To stop a person getting near the king you have to lift then off the floor <br>and they are out. The side with both kings wins.(A chance for energy release)<br>9.Swamp<br>Each patrol stands on chairs on less then the number in the patrol/Six/lodge.(A group of six use 5 <br>chairs).Each patrol then line up in a straight line and race up to the top of the hall and back without <br>getting off the chairs.<br>10.Mine sweeper (Ball in the bag game)<br>You place a ball in a plastic bag and tie a long rope to it. The group forms a circle around the leader he swings <br>the bag around in a circle as the bag arrives the young person jumps if the bag hits him or her they are out.<br>Richard Scriven Selection <br>11.Dice<br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 - 6. All the players run around the room <br>until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a square and sit in it. The leader than throws a <br>dice (preferably a large one) All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! And the game <br>continues for there. It works better with large numbers. <br>12.Ladders <br>Everyone sits down in two lines opposite some one else. Every pair should have their feet touching. <br>Each pair is given a number; when their u=number is called the pair stand up and run up between <br>everyone’s legs (like a ladder) until they reach to the top, they then run on the outside to the end and <br>up the middle again until they reach their place. The first of the pair who sits down gets a point for <br>their side. <br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts. <br>13.1,2,3 Go<br>The group is split in four and each one stands in a corner. When one is called everyone runs width <br>ways across the hall, then two is called everyone runs length ways and when three is called everyone <br>runs diagonally. There should be plenty of confusion, it can be run as a knockout game. <br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts<br>14.Pass Out <br>All the participants sit in a large circle and number off in fours. When a number is called everyone with <br>that number gets up and runs around the circle in the same direction. When someone is passed out by <br>another player they are knocked out. The object is for one person to be left running around at the <br>end. Then the game leader calls another and it continues. <br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts. <br>15.Bench Ball <br>This game involves patrol-sized teams. The object of the game is to score a goal by throwing the ball <br>to your own goalie who is standing on a bench at the end of the hall. Each team has a goalie at either <br>end of the hall. When they have the ball, players cannot move from the spot they are on, they must <br>throw it to a team mate. <br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts. <br>Ciara Higgins’ Selection <br>16.Tiny Island<br>A circle big enough for all the people playing is chalked in the centre of the hall. The players are split in <br>half and each half is sent to a different end of the hall. When ‘Tiny Island’ is called by the leader, all the <br>players must run into the chalked circle. When the leader counts down from five, each player must be <br>fully in the circle (no feet or arms over the edge!). The circle gets smaller and smaller and players are <br>knocked out as they cannot fit inside.<br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts. <br>17.Ship, Shore<br>One end of the hall is designated ship and one end is designated shore. The leader shouts ship or shore <br>and the players run to that end of the hall. The leader tries to catch the player out by, for example, <br>pointing at ship when calling shore, or by calling ship when the players are already at ship. The last <br>player to reach the end called or if a player moves from the end they are at when that end is called, is <br>out. The leader introduces new concepts into the game such as:<br>− Captain’s Coming: The players must all stand to attention and make a salute sign. They must <br>freeze as if the Captain is coming. If a player moves they are out.<br>− Sharks: The players must get themselves off the floor by what ever means necessary to avoid <br>the sharks.<br>− Scrub the Decks: The players must drop to their knees and scrub the ground.<br>− Climb the Rigging: The players must make a ‘climbing up a ladder’ motion.<br>− Ballroom Dancing: The players must get into pairs and begin ballroom dancing.<br>Suitable for Beavers<br>18.Numbers<br>The players all run around the hall and when the leader shouts a number, the players must get into <br>groupings of that number. If players cannot make up a grouping of that number they are out.<br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs.<br>19.Pairs<br>The players get into pairs. They must then run around the hall, away from their partners. When the <br>whistle is blown they must find their partner, link arms backwards and sit down (with their arms still <br>linked). The last pair to find each other and sit down are out.<br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs. <br>20.Scotch<br>The players run around the hall and when they are running a tennis ball is introduced into the mix. When <br>a player catches the ball in their hands they shout ‘Scotch’. At this point all other players must freeze. <br>The player with the ball in their hands can turn by pivoting on one foot but cannot move otherwise. They <br>must throw the ball at someone and try and hit them to get them out. Once the ball has left the players <br>hands all the other players can move again and dodge the ball being thrown at them. If a player is hit by <br>the ball they are out.<br>Suitable for Scouts and Venture Scouts. <br>Michael John Shinnick Selection<br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results <br>and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they <br>must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a <br>hat.<br>21. Ice Rescue <br>Read aloud--once: <br>Your patrol is at a winter camp near an ice-covered lake. One of the Scouts disobeys orders and goes <br>out onto the ice. It breaks. He is struggling in the freezing water. <br>Send your smallest Scout to the other end of the room. He is the victim. (Wait until this is done.) <br>The tallest Scout in the patrol runs out to rescue him. When he gets close, the ice breaks under him <br>too. Now there are two Scouts in the water. (Wait until this is done.) <br>Demonstrate how you would handle this situation<br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT—G<br>Correct Action:<br>The Scouts should lie flat on their stomachs and form a human chain. Each Scout holds the ankles of <br>the person ahead and the \"chain\" worms its way to the victim. This approach spreads the weight over <br>a larger surface. <br>22..—GO Lightning <br>Read aloud--once: <br>This room is a big open field. This chair in the centre of the room (place chair in centre of room) is a <br>tall tree. Your patrol is hiking across the field. The sky has just darkened and there is the sound of <br>thunder. You have just seen flashes of lightning. <br>Each of you demonstrate what you would do. <br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT--GO<br>Correct Action:<br>Scouts should get away from tree and keep low to the ground. Find a depression or ditch if possible<br>23. Accidental Hypothermia <br>Read aloud--once: <br>Your patrol is on a hike. The air temperature is around 10 degrees C. There is a cool breeze blowing. <br>Earlier, there had been some rain but now there's just a fine drizzle. <br>You meet another person on the trail. The tallest Scout in the patrol to act as this person. <br>(Wait until this is done). <br>When you greet him, he replies that it sure is a cold day. You notice that he is shivering and seems to <br>have difficulty speaking. His clothes are wet. Demonstrate what you would do. <br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT--GO!<br>Correct Action:<br>Get victim out of wind and rain. Insulate him from the ground and replace wet clothing. Put victim <br>into a pre warmed sleeping bag. As victim is conscious, give him hot fluids such as soup or tea. Build a <br>fire for warmth and huddle close for body heat. Do not rub or massage. <br>24 Fire in Tall Building <br>Read aloud--once: <br>Your patrol is visiting the tallest building in Canada. You are on the top floor. The door of this room is <br>the elevator. The other door (or corner) is the stairs. Suddenly an office opens and a woman comes <br>into the corridor. She says: \"There's a fire four floors below us. Everybody must leave the building.\" <br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT--GO!<br>Correct Action:<br>The Scout should go to the stair door, feel it and then open it. No one should enter the elevator. <br>Explain to the Scout that automatic elevator buttons are often heat activated and as a result the <br>elevator will take passengers straight to the fire floor. Then the doors won't close because the smoke <br>puts the electric eye out of action. The elevator shaft will act like a chimney flue and suck flames and <br>smoke into the elevator car. <br>25 Nosebleed <br>Read aloud--once: <br>Each of you has a nosebleed. Demonstrate how you handle this situation. <br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT--GO!<br>Correct Action:<br>Each Scout should sit down and lean slightly forward. Breathing through the mouth, each Scout should <br>press his nostrils firmly together. <br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results <br>and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they <br>must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a <br>hat.<br>Stephen Carey’s Selection<br>26.Swing Ball:<br>All participants stand in a circle and the leader stands in the middle with a ball on a rope (a ball in a <br>black bag works well). As the leader swings the ball the participants have to jump over it. If they hit <br>the ball they are out<br>Suitable for beavers, cubs, scouts and ventures<br>27.No Man’s Land:<br>Participants separated into two teams and two lines of chairs set across the hall about 3 foot apart. <br>The object is to hit someone on the opposing team with a ball, on being hit they are out. If someone <br>catches the ball there person who threw it is out! If the ball lands in “no mans land” its anybodies, but <br>can’t be throw at the opposing team from no mans land! Sponge balls are best.<br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br>28.Bucket Ball:<br>Participants are separated into two teams and a member of each team stands on a chair at the <br>opposing end of the hall to their team with a bucket in their hands. The object of the game is to throw <br>the ball into their teams bucket to score a point. It’s a non contact game and the only way the ball can <br>be intercepted by the other team is when its flying through the air. Also they can’t travel with the ball!<br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br>29.Danish 1,2,3<br>Participants are paired off and asked to stand in a circle in 2 deep. (i.e you then have an inner and an <br>outer circle) There are 3 commands. On the command of “1” the couple simply swap places. On <br>command “2” all the scouts behind must go under the legs of the scout in front of them. On command <br>“3” all the scouts behind must run around the perimeter of the circle (clockwise) back to their partner <br>and then go under their legs and stand back up. The slowest couple on each command is out!<br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br>30.Poision Ivy<br>Participants join hands in a circle and a chair is placed in the middle. If you hit the chair you are out. <br>The object is to get the person next to you to hit the chair.<br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Ventures.<br>Martin Burbridge (Chief Scout) Selection<br>31. Human X’s and O’s:<br>Set out a grid of nine squares or chairs.  Split into two teams, one X’s other O’s.  No speaking or sign <br>language allowed.  Each player takes up a position to see if their team can form a line of three either <br>diagonally, vertically or horizontally.<br>32. Spin Dizzy:<br>Relay team game.  Place a coin on the floor at one end of the room with teams at the other.  Each <br>player runs up and places a finger or thumb on the coin and does three circles returning to tag the <br>next player.  Team to finish first wins.<br>33. Blindfold trail (indoor or outdoor):<br>Lay a course with sisal or rope.  Take appropriate safety precautions.  All but one/two member/s of <br>the team blindfolded.  They must guide the team around the course with verbal instructions only.<br>34. Human snakes and ladders:<br>Construction snakes and ladders board on the ground.  Use ropes for snakes and some other <br>materials, e.g. benches, for ladders.  Throw a big dice and move that number of squares.  If you land <br>on a ladder go up or on a snake go back down.<br>35. Pancake race:<br>Each Patrol makes pancake batter for pancakes.  When almost cooked the pancake must be tossed in <br>the air with the frying pan passed to the next scout to catch it.  He/she then makes the next pancake <br>and tosses it, passes the frying pan to the next scout and so on.  If a pancake is not caught they have <br>to cook another one.  First Patrol to cook enough pancakes for all the patrol to eat wins.<br>Noel O’Connor Selection<br>36. Duck!!!<br>Each patrol lines up behind their PL.  A bit in front of their patrols is a small spar.  The first member <br>runs to the spar &amp; throws it to the 2nd.   The 2nd throws it back &amp; DUCKS!!!!.  The PL then throws it to <br>the third etc… until all members have caught.  The PL then runs to the end of the team &amp; the process <br>continues until the PL is back at the front.  Don’t forget to DUCK!!!<br>37. Statues:<br>A game for the entire troop.  Everyone moves around the den, (maybe to music), when the music <br>stops or lights go off, everyone must freeze.  Last man is out…  Laughing also counts as out!!!<br>38. Fruit Bowl:<br>Troop sits around in a circle with one person left out in the middle! Pick 4 fruits, each person is <br>assigned a fruit, (apples, oranges, bananas, pear).  Call out a fruit name &amp; all the apples must swap <br>chairs.  The person in the middle must try capture a chair for himself to get someone else to stand in <br>the middle.<br>39. Sentry Towers:<br>One or two people sit on chairs near the top of the den, they are blindfolded.  One by one the troop <br>must sneak past/crawl without being caught.  You could get the people on sentry duty to either point <br>or throw a ball at their attackers.<br>40. Jousting Jockey Back Race:<br>Each Patrol makes lines up behind the PL at one end of the den.  At the other end of the den there is a number <br>of plastic cups standing upright.  The patrol can swap around who is the horse. A member of the patrol gives <br>another a jockey back as far as the cups, while the person is still on their back, they must try pick the cup up <br>using their lance (a broom handle!!!).  First patrol back in line wins.<br>Julie Malone’s Selection<br>41. Hunt the Leader<br>Outline<br>Playing time: From 60 to 60 minutes<br>Number of players: From 9 to 50<br>Played as: Team<br>Suitable location: Outdoors<br>Equipment<br>• Outrageous disguises<br>Description<br>The Leaders disguise themselves as well as possible and hide somewhere in the locality (a friendly <br>town is ideal). E.g. Elderly lady at hairdressers, tramp in park, punks in phone box etc. (All been done <br>before!).<br>Scouts have to find leaders and obtain password. I would suggest in small groups of 3-4 depending on <br>age etc. Works best when children are unaccompanied so older children are better.<br>Best bit is listening to the children debate who is to approach elderly lady/tramp/punk and ask if they <br>are really a Scout Leader!!<br>Lots of preparation needed!!<br>Takes several hours, but combines well with a shopping trip.<br>Also long periods of boredom for leaders, punctuated by short periods of stifling giggles!<br>42. The Bomb Mission<br>An explosive wide game<br>Outline<br>Playing time: From 30 to 60 minutes<br>Number of players: From 12 to 36<br>Played as: Team<br>Suitable location: Outdoors<br>Type of game: Team<br>Equipment<br>• Balloons <br>• Whistles <br>• Torches<br>Description<br>This game needs to be played in an area with hiding places such as a wood.<br>Create a number of equal teams, each team will be sent off to a different part of the playing area.<br>A number of Leaders (or PL's) are given the task of either handing out the Bombs (balloons) or <br>discharging them (popping).<br>Each balloon is marked by the team who is carrying it so it can be identified later.<br>The thing that makes this game harder is that the Leaders hide themselves so that the Scouts have to <br>use their sense of hearing and sight to find them.<br>The disposal units have a whistle and the people who hand the balloons have torches. These are<br>sounded at 1-minute intervals so that they can be found.<br>At the end of the game the team who has disposed of the most balloons are the winners.<br>To add a new element into the game you can have extra Scouts who can pop the balloons in transit.<br>Before starting define a game over signal<br>43. Below the Knees<br>Requires speed and agility to avoid being hit<br>Outline<br>Playing time: From 5 to 15 minutes<br>Number of players: From 10 to 40<br>Played as: Individuals<br>Suitable location: Indoors<br>Equipment<br>• A football<br>Description<br>Leaders stand in each corner of the room.<br>Players start in the centre of the room and are able to move around.<br>Object of the game is to avoid being hit \"Below The Knees\" by the football.<br>Leaders throw the ball into the centre of the room aiming to hit the players below the knees.<br>When a player is \"out\" they move away from the play area<br>Last one left is the winner<br>Variations: - more than one football<br>: - Players who are out join the throwers<br>: - Leaders stand in the centre and the players round around the outside<br>44.Chair Attack<br>Outline<br>A game where you aren't out<br>Playing time: From 5 to 30 minutes<br>Number of players: From 4 to 100 <br>Played as: Individuals<br>Suitable location: Indoors<br>Type of game:  Individual<br>Equipment<br>• A Chair per person <br>• A very soft ball<br>Description<br>Each player has a chair, which is placed against a wall.<br>Every player stands up, and tries to kick the ball at any other Scouts chair. Once your chair has been <br>hit you sit down on your chair but you can still take part in the game but only from a sitting position <br>and if the ball comes to you.<br>Last person whose seat has not been hit with the ball is the winner.<br>An interesting variation is to have teams of three or four players. If the ball is kicked too high a penalty <br>of 2 minutes sitting down is imposed. If you want game to go on for a long time each player only sits <br>out for five minutes when the ball hits the chair.<br>45.Quadrants<br>Fast and furious ball game<br>Outline<br>Playing time: From 10 to 20 minutes <br>Number of players: From 8 to 20<br>Played as: Team <br>Suitable location: Indoors<br>Type of game: Team<br>Equipment<br>• A long rope or four shorter pieces <br>• A large area clear of breakable items, but with some obstacles if available. <br>• Whistle <br>• Referee/timer.<br>Description<br>The room/enclosed area is divided into four equal quadrants by the rope. The players are divided into <br>equal teams &amp; each team takes a quadrant.<br>The ball is thrown in and passed around. The Whistle is blown every 30 seconds and whoever has the <br>ball in their quadrant loses a point. Loser is first to lose all allocated points.<br>Aim of the game is to get the ball out of your area and into some else's as fast as possible.<br>Francis Minogue Selection<br>46. ZIG ZAG (Energy Release)<br>Get the Patrols to line up in straight lines kneeling on 1 knee behind a marker (Chair or similar). Each <br>Marker is given a number: 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. The numbers remain stationery through-out the game. <br>When you call 1 &amp; 4 for example – row 1 changes places with row 4 (zig sagging through rows 2 &amp; 3 to <br>get to their new places). The last scout in their new place on one knee is out.<br>Repeat until only 1 scout remains. The faster the game is played the better.<br>47. Fruit bowl (Energy Release)<br>All Scouts sit in a circle on chairs. The Game Leader goes around the circle assigning everyone a fruit in <br>turn from Apple, Orange, Pear, Banana.<br>When Apple is called – all the Apples must stand up and as quickly as possible run across the circle to <br>an unoccupied chair on the other side. Each round at least one chair is removed from the circle. The <br>Scout who ends up without a chair is out.<br>When Fruit bowl is called – all Scouts get up and cross the circle to another unoccupied chair.<br>Continue the rounds until only one scout remains.<br>48. Bamboo Circle Game<br>Get all the Scouts to stand in a circle holding a Bamboo Cane upright touching the floor (between 5 &amp; 6 <br>foot long). The calls are Left, Right and About.<br>When Left is called – each Scout must let go their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow <br>scouts to push the cane in any direction). They then move left to catch the Cane on their immediate <br>left. Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br>When Right is called – each Scout must let go their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow <br>scouts to push the cane in any direction). They then move right to catch the Cane on their immediate <br>left. Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br>When About is Called – each Scout must let their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow <br>scouts to push the cane in any direction). Spin around through 360 degrees and then recatch their own <br>Bamboo Cane.  Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br>Continue until 2 scouts remain. Then position the Scout about 10 feet apart. When you shout Go – both <br>let go their cane and race across to catch the other cane. IF both are successful increase the Gap and <br>continue running the races until one Scout fails to catch the cane.<br>49. Compass Game (Energy Release &amp; Compass Skill)<br>Allocate the 4 walls in the room one of the 4 Cardinal Points (North, South, East &amp; West). When you call <br>North – all the Scouts must run to the North wall. The last person to touch the wall is out. Continue <br>until only 1 scout remains.<br>For added complication – use the instructions for the Corners of the room (I.e. North East; North West; <br>South East and South West)<br>50. Leap frog relay <br>The Patrols stand in rows with about 2 metres between each Scout. The Scouts bend over and the last <br>one in line leapfrogs over their backs. As soon as he has got into position 2 mts. in front of the last one, <br>the next Scout at the back of the line starts to jump, and so on. The first Patrol to finish leapfrogging is <br>the winner.<br>  <br>John Brennan’s Selection<br>   51. Blow Ball<br>Two table tennis balls required. Mark a course say 6meters wide with a chalk line. Participants <br>on command blow the tennis ball over the line. First over wins.<br>   52. Nose Ball<br>Staying with the tennis ball same set up but this time nose it across the line blowing it means<br>your out.<br>   53. Blow Cones<br>Make 2 cones from A4 paper. Set up 4 anchor points(Chairs?)<br>Tie one end of a piece of string of say 10 meters to one chair each. Place the cone on the string <br>by passing it through both ends and secure to the opposite chair making two \"courses\" on <br>Command the participants move the cone along the string by blowing into the cone. First <br>Home wins.<br>   54. Ship to shore<br>Action Game using words Ship, Shore, Bombers, ones, twos etc. Designate one Wall as Ship <br>one as Shore and the floor becomes bombers. On Shouting Ship they run to the designated <br>wall, Shore to the designated Wall and fir bombers hit the floor. 5 minutes and all the energy is <br>gone.<br>  <br>     55. Object Chase<br>Place the group into a large circle with hands open behind their back. One is nominated and <br>given an object (Say a pen) and the individual walks or runs around the outside of the circle. <br>The participant places the pen into the hands of his or her choosing and runs round the circle <br>to get back to that persons place in the circle before being caught. If not caught person 2 <br>carries on in the same fashion. If caught then person 1 starts again.<br>     <br>       56. Pick and Chase<br>Two parallel rows of participants numbered off. The rows should be at least 2 meters apart. <br>Place an object in the centre of the floor and call off a number say 2. The idea is to get out grab <br>the object and back to your own side without being caught. A winner is someone who gets <br>away without being caught<br>1st/10th Westmeath Mullingar Selection<br>57. Nosey Parker<br>Scouts line up in relay formation. First Scout in each line, puts a matchbox on the end <br>of his/her nose, completes a given course, and returns to pass the matchbox to the next scout, <br>without using their hands…from nose to nose, and so it continues!!<br>58. Squankles<br>Scouts in relay formation, each scout grabs his/her own ankles and without letting go, <br>must complete the course in relay fashion.<br>59. Scramble<br>Each scout removes his/her footwear and places it in a pile in the centre of the room, then the <br>scouis all face the walls of the room. Leaders mix the footwear up, carefully separating those left in <br>pairs. On a given command, the scouts must find their shoes, put them on and first patrol back in <br>formation at alert, wins! (This game is especially difficult in a dark hall if the lights are turned on and <br>off at 15 second intervals!)<br>60. Shark Island<br>A rope is laid in a circle on the floor. This is the island. Get all scouts to stand inside the <br>rope boundary. When a leader shouts “All Clear” the scouts must leave the island because it is safe to <br>do so,  and step outside the rope. At this point, a leader pulls the rope (loop) a little tighter, making <br>the island a little smaller. When a Leader shouts “Sharks”, the scouts must all get back on the island. <br>Any scout not able to get inside the rope is out. The Leaders keep reducing the size of the island every <br>couple of minutes during the “all clear” sessions. Last one on Island is the winner!!<br>61. Tug ‘o’ Knots<br>Every scout has a 1 metre length piece of rope. In patrols or relay formation, on a given <br>command, each scout joins his/her rope to the next scouts rope. First team finished with one rope <br>made from all pieces, wins points; then have a tug of war by joining two opposing teams ropes <br>together. Winners get points for winning tug of war. Tug of war ropes are separated after each heat. <br>At the end of the tug of war, each group reforms into patrols / relay formation and on command untie <br>all the knots. First patrol with all 1 metre pieces of rope untied gain the last points. Team with most <br>points wins. (Very useful for weekly patrol challenges). <br>Geraldine Smith, PSO in Dublin Province Selection<br>62. Jingle the Keys<br>The players stand in a circle with one in the centre with his eyes shut.  The leader gives keys on a ring <br>to one of the players, who jingles them and then holds them still, whereupon the centre player tries <br>to go and get them.  If he cannot locate them, he is helped by a slight jingle.  When he locates them, <br>the leader nods to another player who says, “Bring them to me.”  The centre player, with his eyes still <br>shut, tries to take them to the one who requested him to do so.<br>63. The Prince of Paris<br>The players sit in a semi circle and number off consecutively.  The leader is seated at the end to the <br>right and starts the game by saying, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat.  Did you find it, Number Six, <br>sir?”  (Naturally, the leader may call on any player.)<br>Number Six immediately answers, “What sir!  I sir?”  The following conversation is continued between <br>the leader and Number Six:<br>Leader: Yes sir, you sir!<br>Number Six: No sir, not I sir!<br>Leader: Who then, sir?<br>Number Six: Number Ten, sir!<br>The leader now tries to say, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat,” before Number Ten can say, “What <br>sir!  I, sir?”  If Number Ten succeeds, he and the leader carry on the identical conversation, which took <br>place between Number Six and the leader.  Should the leader succeed, he and Number Ten exchange <br>places.  Should any player make a mistake in repeating the conversation, he must exchange places <br>with the leader.<br>64. Buzz<br>The players are seated in a circle.  One player starts the game by saying, “One;” the next says, “Two;” <br>the counting proceeding around the circle until the number seven is reached, for which the word <br>“buzz” is substituted.<br>The players continue counting, always substituting “buzz” for any number in which the digit seven <br>occurs, such as seventeen or twenty seven.  “Buzz” is also substituted for any number which is a <br>multiple of seven, such as fourteen or twenty one.  Upon reaching seventy, the counting proceeds as <br>“buzz-one,” “buzz-two,” etc.  Seventy-seven is “buzz-buzz.”<br>Should a player say “buzz” in the wrong place, give a number when he should have said “buzz,” or call <br>a wrong number, he drops out of the game.  The counting continues from where the mistake was <br>made.  The game proceeds until all are out.<br>65. Telegrams<br>The player’s sit in a circle and each try to write a clever telegram the words of which begin with the <br>letters of his right-hand neighbour’s name.  For instance, Smith would require words beginning with <br>the following letters: S  m i t h.  When the telegrams are completed, each passes his on to his right <br>hand neighbour and each in turn reads the one he received.<br>66.A Trip to Europe<br>The players sit in a circle.  One of them, whom we shall call “Smith” starts the game by saying, “I’m <br>going to Europe and I’d like to have all of you go along if you will bring the things I want you to bring.  I <br>am going to take a salmon.”  If the player knows the game, he takes something the name of which <br>begins with the first letter of either his given name or his surname, and is welcomed into the party, <br>but if the player is unacquainted with the game, he may offer to bring something that is not <br>acceptable, and therefore be told regretfully that he cannot go.  The game goes on until all discover <br>why they mayor may not go on the trip to Europe or until they give up.<br>4th Port Dodder Sea Scout Group Selection<br>67. My Grandmother Doesn’t Like Tea<br>One player who knows the game begins saying, “My grandmother doesn’t like tea but she likes <br>coffee.”  The other players ask if she likes this or that, for example, “Does she like cake?”  The first <br>player may answer, “No, but she likes cookies.”  If there are players in the group who know the game <br>they join with the first player and tell what their grandmothers like or do not like, and as they others <br>discover the reason for these likes and dislikes, they also join this group.  This continues until all the <br>players have discovered that “grandmother” does not like anything the name of which contains the <br>letter “t,” but she does like everything the name of which contains double letters<br>68. Wireless<br>Two people take hold of the ends of a towel or string and swing it round and round between them, <br>ostensibly “to get the air waves going” but in reality to listen for someone to speak.  When someone <br>does speak, one of the two asks the other if he got the message.  If he is uncertain as to who spoke, <br>he says, “No,” and his confederate suggests that they begin again. If he is sure of the identity of the <br>speaker, he says, “Yes,” and leaves the room.  His confederate gives the “message” to the person who <br>spoke immediately before the other player said he got the message.  The “message” may consist of a <br>piece of paper, or anything easily concealed.  The player returns and names the person who received <br>the “message.”  The others try to discover how the trick was done.<br>69. Wink<br>Half the players sit in chairs in a circle with one extra chair vacant, and a player stands behind every <br>chair.  The one with the empty chair winks or nods his head at any seated player, who immediately <br>tries to escape before the person behind his chair tags him.  If he gets away, he occupies the vacant <br>chair but, if tagged, he must remain in his own chair.  The object is to keep one’s chair occupied.<br>70. How Do You Like Your Neighbour?<br>The players sit in a circle, with one in the centre.  They number consecutively, including the centre <br>player.  The centre player goes up to anyone of the other players and asks, “How do you like your <br>neighbour?”  He may answer, “Very well,” in which case all the players must change seats, or he may <br>say, “Not at all,” whereupon the questioner asks, “Whom would you rather have?”  He may say, <br>“Number Six and Thirteen” (any numbers).  These two numbers must then exchange seats with the <br>two who sit on either side of the person who named them.  During the exchange, the questioner tries <br>to get a seat.  The one left without a seat is the next questioner.<br>71. Ocean Wave<br>The players arrange their chairs close together in a circle.  One player then goes into the centre, which <br>leaves one vacant chair.  The centre player calls “Shift right (or left)” and changes the call whenever he <br>wishes.  The players endeavour to keep the chair on the right or left occupied while shifting as <br>directed.  In the meantime the centre player tries to get a seat.  Whoever is at fault in case he <br>succeeds exchanges places with him.<br>Tina Finn Selection 32nd Rathgar Scout Group<br>72. Magpies<br>Equipment: 1 matchbox per child.<br>How many things can each child fit in the matchbox in 10 minutes?<br>Blade of grass, daisey, feather, pebble, etc.<br>73. Guessing Game<br>Equipment: Have 10 items of fruit and veg ( in season ) in a large pillow case.<br>Each child in turn feels inside the bag and tries to guess what they are. You could play this as a tasting <br>game as well. Blindfold the child and they taste a selection of fruit and veg.<br>74. Back to Back Run<br>The children find partners, stand back to back and link elbows. Their challenge is to run to a spot and <br>back, one facing forwards and the other backwards. To return to the start point after reaching the <br>given spot, they don't turn around but merely switch roles.<br>75. Character pair matching<br>Write names of farm animals on two cards for each animal. Distribute randomly to the children and <br>get them to find their corresponding pair by making the noise of that animal.<br>76. Balloon Blow<br>Equipment: Balloons ( blown up)<br>Line the children up into two teams and give each child a balloon. On the word \"GO\" each child must, <br>in turn, blow their balloon along the floor to the end of the hall ( or a marked spot ). and then return <br>to the end of the line as fast as possible. The next child then takes their turn.<br>4th Fermanagh Scouts, Lisnaskea Selection<br>77. Dice Game<br>You need six large sheets of card and a large dice. On each sheet of card draw large dots to <br>correspond with each side of the dice. Lay the card on the floor. The children run around and stand on <br>one of the pieces of card, throw the dice and whatever number it lands on the children standing on <br>the corresponding number are out.<br>78. Tyre game<br>We use a tube from the inside of a large tyre that is inflated as big as it will go. Divide the children into <br>two teams and number them 1 – 8 etc. Get them to stand at opposite ends of the hall. When you call <br>a number the person from each team with the corresponding number run forward and try to drag the <br>tyre back to their team to score a point. This is great craic with the tyre as it is so big it is easy for both <br>team members to pull on. Even better fun if you call two numbers at the same time. We usually finish <br>with calling all the numbers.<br>79. Snow Shoes<br>This game originated in Canada and we came across it when we were doing scouting around the <br>world. You need to divide the children into teams and you need two plastic shopping bags per team. <br>The idea is to get from one end of the den to the other using the bags as stepping-stones, as the bags <br>slide under their feet it makes it more fun. Done in a relay fashion the first team with all their <br>members back first is the winner.<br>80. Prayer or promise relay<br>Print out the prayer / promise and cut into words or phrases (which we have laminated and prepare <br>one set for each team) place them all jumbled up on a table at one end of the hall. Divide the kids into <br>teams. Done as a relay the idea is to get them to run down to the table and select one section and <br>bring it back to the team, as each member returns they start to assemble the words into the correct <br>order and the winning team is the first one to collect all the pieces and have them in the right order. <br>This is a great game for the start of the year to help them learn the prayer and promise.<br>81. Scott’s Game <br>Get the children to scatter around the hall in groups of three with arms linked. One person has to do <br>runner and one to do catcher. The catcher chases the runner but if the runner links onto one of the <br>groups of three the person at the opposite end of the link has to let go and become the runner. If the <br>runner gets caught they automatically become the catcher. This is a game that can last for ages.<br>3RD Monaghan Carrickmacross  Venturers  Selection<br>82. Cereal box.<br>Group of 3 to 20.<br>Equipment:- A cereal box.<br>The Cereal box is placed in the centre of the room and all the participants from a circle around it.  The <br>first person walks forward and picks up the box with their teeth not using their hands and not letting <br>their hands touch the ground.  The bit they grab in their teeth is then ripped of the box and the box is <br>replace in the centre of the circle.  The next person in turn picks up the box in the teeth and rips of a <br>bit.  As the game continues the box get smaller and is harder to pick up using only your teeth.  There <br>are two reason someone is put out.  If they touch their hand on the ground or if they cant pick up the <br>box.  The last person left in the circle is the winner.<br>83. Shave the Balloon <br>Equipment :- Balloons ,bic shavers and shaving foam.<br>Fill the ballons with shaving foam and cover the outside of them with foam.  The aim of the game is <br>the first person to shave all the foam of the balloon is the winner. <br>84. Electricity game <br>2 teams of people lye on the ground and hold hands to from a chain.  The team must keep the eyes <br>closed for the duration of the game.  Then the leader sits at the end the holds the first persons hand in <br>the team.  The leader squeeze’s the hand of the first in the line.  They first in the line squeezes the <br>hand of the second in line and the second squeeze the third and so on to the top of the line.  When <br>the last person in the line receives the squeeze he/she jumps up the runs to the end of the room and <br>tips the wall.  The first team to tip the wall wins.     <br>85. Polo game<br>For 2 teams of 4 to 8 people.<br>Equipment:- Cocktail stick for each person, packet of polo sweets.<br>The teams sit on the ground with there back against a wall shoulder to shoulder in a line.  Each person <br>is given a cocktail stick.  Each person must put the cocktail stick in the their mouth and hands behind <br>their back.  The first person is given a polo and it is place on their cocktail stick.  They must pass the <br>polo to the next in line using only the cocktail stick.  The polo is passed from cocktail stick to cocktail <br>stick to the end of the line.  The two teams can have a race.   <br>132nd  Eagle Troop, Bayside  Selection<br>86. “Bomb the Bridges”    4-6 Tennis balls<br>The scouts stand scattered around the Den with their legs around 2ft apart. Each scout’s legs <br>form a “bridge” which may be bombed. To bomb a “bridge”, a tennis ball must be thrown <br>between the scout’s legs (hitting a player’s legs is not enough). Once bombed, the scout is out <br>and must sit down. However, they may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to <br>bomb other players. The last scout standing is the winner. To prevent being bombed the scout <br>may protect his/herself using hands to catch or deflect the tennis ball. Scouts may not move <br>their feet or crouch to prevent being “hit”. Balls which are out of reach may be retrieved <br>quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of balls the <br>harder and faster the game becomes!<br>87.  “Row Ball”     I Large Ball<br>Troop/Pack is divided into two teams who sit in parallel lines about four feet apart, but facing <br>in opposite direction. The feet of each player should just touch the seat of the scout/cub in <br>front. A mark is made halfway down the aisle between the two teams. The ball is placed on <br>this mark. When the Leader calls “Row”, the players use their inner hands only and try to drive <br>the ball to the front of their respective teams. If this is done a goal is scored. The ball must stay <br>on the ground. As a variation, turn the teams around and use the other hands.<br>88.  “Tail Grab “   Rope or Cloth<br>Each Patrol stands in a line behind their Patrol Leader. Each scout holds the belt or waist of the <br>scout in front. The last scout has a “tail” tucked into their trousers (piece of cloth or rope)<br>. On the word “GO” the patrol leaders have to move around the room and try to get as <br>many of the other patrols tails as possible. Any patrols that break their chain are disqualified. <br>The winning patrol is the one with the most tails.<br>89.  “Table Tennis Ball Relay”   Party blowers and table tennis balls<br>Each player gets a party blower ( the type that unrolls when you blow it ) that he/she uses to <br>push the table tennis ball across the floor. The scout/cub can only use the party blower, <br>nothing else, he/she can’t blow the ball themselves or touch it in any way except for the <br>blower.<br>90.  “Tilt”     Billy half filled with water for each team, An aluminium foil cake container per team, An <br>Alka-Seltzer tablet per team<br>For each patrol, put an Alka-Seltzer tablet in each foil cake dish and then float one cake dish in <br>each patrol’s billycan. The patrols must now transport the billycan through an obstacle course <br>without the tablet getting wet or falling into the water. They are not allowed to touch the foil <br>case or the tablet. The patrols could either carry the billycans by their handles, or, if you are <br>feeling very mean, you could get them to pick them up between two poles!!<br>3rd Carlow Borris Selection<br>91. Tight Rope<br>Equipment: 1 large and long rope<br>Get all the scouts to stand in a circle each member holding the rope.  Get all members to pull <br>outwards from the circle on the rope (tighten the rope).  Each member in the circle is given a number <br>and when their number is called they must climb onto the rope and walk around the circle on the <br>rope use the members of the circle as support… change it up by having 2 people walk the circle in <br>opposite directions.<br>92.Inside out<br>Patrols stand in a straight line side by side and hold hands.  Objective of the game is for each patrol to <br>turn themselves inside out??  The last member of the team must climb under the legs of the first <br>member of the patrol, second member and so on, without anyone breaking hands.  Watch them tie <br>themselves into a knot, this works good with a large group also?<br>93. 5cent race<br>Patrol relay game.  Each patrol stands at the bottom of the hall in a straight line.  At the top of the hall <br>have a target drawn on the floor (See below blue 5pts, yellow 10pts and red 15pts).  Give each patrol a <br>5cent piece each.  Objective is to transport the 5cent from one end of the hall to the other using only <br>their Buttocks or inner thighs.  (Watch them waddle).  Once the coin is safely transported the scout <br>then attempts to drop it in the target zone.  Patrol with the most pts at the end wins?<br>94.Tazmanian Devil<br>All you need is a sweeping Brush.  Get the scout to hold the head of the sweeping brush into their <br>chest with the handle point up.  With their chin resting on the handle and looking at the top of the <br>broom handle the scout must spin around fast a set number of times (depending on age).  Once they <br>have achieved this they must now bend over and attempt to touch the top of the broom off the floor.  <br>(Be ready to catch them).<br>95. Spoons<br>Equipment:<br>3 Spoons and 3 chairs, basins or zones<br>Place the 3 chairs in the shape of a triangle (5-10 paces away from each other).  Place the 3 spoons in <br>the middle of the triangle (equal distance from any chair).  Now break the scouts into 3 equal groups <br>and number them 1 to X.  With each team standing at their chair their objective is to get 2 spoons on <br>their chair.  The person with the most stamina prevails.<br>Rules: Only can ever have 1 spoon in your hand and no physical contact<br>Aoife FitzPatrick, Section Leader 7th Dublin, Donnybrook Selection<br>96. Danish 1-2-3<br>Divide the troop into pairs and arrange them in a circle. The Scouts should stand in their pairs one behind the <br>other. When the leader blows the whistle once they must switch places with their partners. When the leader <br>blows the whistle twice the person behind must crawl under the legs of their partner. When the leader blows <br>the whistle three times the Scout at the outside must run around the circle in a clockwise direction, get back to <br>their partner, crawl under their legs and stand up in front. The last pair to stand back up in their places are out.<br>97. Stormy Seas<br>Each Scout gets a  chair and  the  troop  sits in a  circle. Each member  of  the  troop is given  the  name  of either <br>mackerel, cod or herring. When the leader calls “Mackerel”, all the mackerels must get up run around the outside <br>of the circle and back to their places. When they reach their own chair they must crawl under it and sit back <br>down. If the leader blows a whistle while they are running they must change direction. The last person back is <br>out (It’s a good idea to ask them to leave the circle but leave their chair there to maintain the size of the circle). <br>If the leader calls “Stormy seas!” everyone must get up and run around the circle.<br>98. It’s under a cup<br>Place a row of about 20 paper cups down the middle of the hall turned upside down. Under each cup place an <br>object (such as key, whistle, spool of thread etc). Divide the troop into two teams and line them up on either side <br>of the hall. Number them off from 1 to whatever. The leader calls a number and an object. The Scouts may only <br>use their right hand to lift cups up and place them back down. The first one to find the object and bring it back <br>to their team wins a point. Don’t allow the Scouts to fling the cups all over the place as all the objects will be <br>revealed. The rest of  the teams should be looking on trying to memorise where all the other items are. <br>99. Timebomb<br>Divide the hall into four even quadrants, with one patrol or team in each one. A leader throws in an object (not <br>bouncy, ie a ball doesn’t work for this. Use a rucksck or a sleeping bag in it’s stuff sack, or a cushion). The patrols <br>must get rid of it out of their area. A blindfolded leader blows a whistle at various intervals. Whichever team has <br>the bomb in their area when the whistle blows gets a point against their team. The team with the least amount <br>of points at the end wins.<br>Alternatively, whoever touches the bomb last before the whistle blows is out. One by one the teams start to get <br>smaller and it becomes harder to defend your own area. If one team is completely out the other teams will lose <br>points/players for throwing the bomb into the empty quadrant.<br>We usually begin by playing the original way and finish up by eliminating people.   <br>100. Prisoner’s Base<br>Divide the troop into two teams. Place a barrier of chairs or benches across the middle of the hall and each team <br>stands in either end of the hall. Towards the back wall of each half draw a chalk line on the ground – this is the <br>prison.<br>A ball is thrown in. Whichever team catches it goes first. They must try to hit the members of the other team <br>with the ball below the waist. If the ball hits the ground first it doesn’t count – the ball must hit the player cleanly <br>on  the  legs  and must  hit  the  ground  afterwards. If  the  ball  hits  a  player’s  legs  but  is  immediately  caught  by <br>someone else the player who has been hit is not out.<br>When a player is hit they must cross over to the prison on the other side of the hall taking the ball with them. <br>They then have one free shot to hit a player from the other team. If they hit someone from the opposition they <br>are allowed to return to their team and the person they hit must cross over to the other prison. However, if they <br>miss  they must  remain in  the  prison  until  the  ball  comes  to  them. If  the  ball  crosses  the  prison line it is  the <br>prisoners’ throw. The rest of their teammates may deliberately throw the ball high and into the prison to help <br>free their prisoners. <br>If a player catches a ball which has been thrown at them the person who threw the ball is out and must go straight <br>to the prison without a free throw.<br>The last person on a team to be hit still has one free throw once they get to prison and may turn the game around!<br>The winning team is the one to send all the opposition to prison.<br>Set up for the hall is as follows:<br>A = Team 1<br>a  =  Team  1’s  prison<br>B = Team 2<br>b = Team 2’s prison<br>a B A b<br>3rd Monaghan Cub Selection<br>101. Ball between Legs<br>The Cubs form a circle with legs apart and with their feet touching their neighbours feet. They place one hand <br>behind their back. A ball (a light, soft sponge ball is ideal) is thrown into the circle and the Cubs use their free <br>hand to try and knock the ball between the legs of the other players. They are allowed to defend themselves <br>with their free hand.<br>If the ball passes through someone’s legs, that person is out. They come out of the circle and the circle moves <br>in to close the gap so that the game can continue. The first Cubs who are out can help to retrieve the ball, and <br>once enough Cubs are out, a second game can be started to keep them occupied. As the number of Cubs in the <br>circle gets fewer the game becomes more frenetic<br>102. Corners<br>Identify each corner by a coloured balloon. When the music starts the Beavers run around or dance in the <br>middle of the hall. When the music stops the Beavers run to any corner. Pull one of the colours out of the bag. <br>All the Beavers in that corner are out, the music starts and the game continues.<br>The last Beaver in wins.<br>103. Dice<br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 - 6.<br>All the players take part. They run around the room until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a <br>square and sit in it.<br>The leader picks the quietest player to throw a dice. All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! Its <br>a gamble!!<br>104. Head Catch<br>Cubs stand in a large circle with a Leader standing in the middle and the leader takes in turn to throw a ball to <br>each player.<br>As the Leader throws, he will say either 'Head' or 'Catch'. The Cub must do the opposite either catching or <br>heading the ball.<br>If the player does the wrong option they must sit down and the winner is the last player standing.<br>To make it slightly more taxing the Leader can randomly choose Cubs as opposed to just going round the circle <br>in order.<br>Some additions are for the players to go down an their knees rather than being out and if they get it right next <br>time they are back standing, get it wrong and they are out.<br>3rd Monaghan Carrickmacross Scout Selection<br>105. Matching Cards<br>Equipment<br>Fronts off Christmas or Birthday cards <br>A pair of scissors<br>Cut the Cards up into halves, make it more interesting by cutting the cards with a curved line not a straight one. <br>When the cards have been cut, hand one half to one beaver and the other half to another beaver and do the <br>same with the next card and so on until each beaver has half a card. The beavers then go around looking for the <br>beaver with the other half of their card and when they find them they have to introduce themselves to each <br>other. This is a great game to play on the first night back after Christmas, especially if you have new beavers <br>joining the colony.<br>106. Moon Men<br>Equipment<br>Pieces of card, approx 150mm x 200mm (6\" x 8\"), large enough for two Beavers to stand on at the same time, <br>with their feet completely on the card. <br>You will need enough pieces for all your Beavers to stand on (12 pieces of a colony of 24 etc)<br>Sprinkle the card around the room<br>Get the Beavers walling or running around the card 'craters' in a circle<br>When a Leader shouts 'Monster Coming' each Beaver must jump in a crater, represented by having all of both <br>feet on a piece of card.<br>To start with there are enough pieces of card for all the boys, but after each go, remove one piece of card. Any <br>Beaver failing to fit in a crater is out.<br>The game continues until there are just two Beavers left.<br>VARIATIONS:<br>Many variations can be played, such as playing in shark infested waters. When the Beavers hear 'Shark <br>Coming!' they have to climb on an island<br>With this version you can shout 'Tide Turning' to reverse the direction the Beavers walk/run around; 'Storm!' to <br>get them to exaggerate their swimming movements.<br>107. Nuts!<br>Equipment<br>A plate per player <br>5 items per player, ie. spoon, pen, pencil sharpener, anything!<br>Each Beaver stands by his plate with his five items on it. At the blow of a whistle they  have to go to another <br>Beavers plate and take one item from it, and put it onto their own plate. They continue to do this, going to any <br>Beavers plate, until the second whistle is blown. The winner is the Beaver with the most items on their plate.<br>108. The Chair Game<br>Each player stands behind a chair which are arranged in a circle, with the chairs facing in.<br>On a shout of \"1\", the players move one chair to the left.<br>On \"2\" the players move one chair to the right.<br>On \"3\" the players sit down on the chair they should be standing behind.<br>The last person to sit down in the correct chair stays sitting down and that chair must then be avoided by <br>everyone else.<br>Common shout would be \"1,1,1,2,2,1,3!\" etc...<br>If this gets too easy, reverse the meaning of \"1\" and \"2\" half way through the game<br>109. Backbreaking Skittles<br>Equipment<br>Sturdy chairs are required if playing with Scouts!<br>Several light/soft footballs <br>Six plastic skittles <br>Chalk (or sting to divide area)<br>This is best played in an enclosed area such as a hall.<br>Divide your area in half with a chalk line, which is not to be crossed by either team.<br>Select two equal teams. Place three skittles per team equally spaced across the hall about 20 feet back from <br>the line, in each team's territory.<br>The idea is for each team to knock down all three of the opposing team's skittles, whilst defending their own. <br>Several balls are used at once, however they can only be reclaimed from within the team's own territory, no <br>crossing the line. The winning team's score is the number of their own skittles standing once the other teams <br>are all knocked down. A number of rounds can be nominated and the aggregate score calculated for the final <br>score. Players may only throw the balls under-arm. Using back and side walls to rebound off is allowed and is a <br>good way to get round blockers. Teamwork in the form of passing along the line will also help. All players must<br>stay on their feet when blocking incoming balls, and only one player at a time may directly block each skittle.<br>110. Holding your Water<br>Equipment<br>Lots of water bombs filled with cold water<br>Holding yu<br>111. Find it<br>A football is placed in the middle of the hall, and one Scout from each Patrol is blindfolded, each starting from <br>different positions but all an equal distant from the ball, crawls forward to find the ball. His aim is then to <br>return to his Patrol with it. Each Scout must crawl on his stomach the whole time, unless the Scooter prefers <br>them to be on all fours. If a Scout finds the ball, the others can try to take it from him by any means possible <br>until the ball reaches a base. A struggle may result. Should the ball be returned to the wrong base, the owner of <br>that base wins. Some prefer this game to be played in dead silence, while others allow<br>Patrols to shout advice and directions to their representative.<br>112. Over and under<br>The Patrols line up in file order. The Patrol Leader runs to the front of the play area, and touches a marker, <br>returns to the front of the Patrol and crawls between the legs of the Scouts, through the Patrol, touches a <br>marker behind the Patrol and returns to his place over the backs of the Patrol. When he is in place, number two <br>sets off over the back of the Patrol Leader, runs to the marker in front, back and under the legs of the Patrol, <br>over the backs of the Patrol and back<br>into his place. This is continued until the whole Patrol has had a turn.<br>113.Find the Colour<br>A Leader calls a colour and the Patrol Leader, or a Scout taking turns, gets something that colour to the Leader. <br>The first one gets a point, the highest score wins.<br>114.Skittle Knockout<br>Two teams sit either side of the hall and everyone is given a number.<br>A skittle is placed in the middle of the floor with a chair at each end of the hall and a tennis ball on each one. <br>When a number is called the two players with that number run to their designated chair, sit down and throw <br>the tennis ball at the skittle, each gets two chances and the one who knocks the skittle down first gets a point.<br>115.Fumball<br>This is in individual competitive game to develop skill in catching and accurate, quick throwing.<br>A line is drawn on the ground parallel to and about 3 metres away from the wall, and another line at about <br>waist height on the wall.<br>The players stand behind the line and one throws the ball at the wall. It has to hit below the line.<br>The ball must be caught cleanly by whoever is closest to it when it bounces back. If they fumble it, miss it or it <br>hits them, they have to run to the wall and touch the wall before another player can retrieve the ball and throw <br>it at the wall.<br>If the second Scout fumbles it, or it hits the wall above the line, they too have to run and touch the wall before <br>someone else throws the ball at it, and so on.....<br>If the ball hits the wall before the Scout touches it, he/she either loses a life.<br>This is a fast and chaotic game, and it needs careful control, but the Scouts (and older Cubs) enjoy it very much.<br>116. Obstacle Course<br>Make an Obstacle Course out of the chairs etc. define a route to be used.<br>All members of the Patrol must complete the course in turn. Or this can be a race between patrols.<br>117.Beach ball<br>The game involves keeping a beach ball in the air. The group stand in a circle and try to keep the ball up for at <br>least 100 touches. This figure increases as it is reached.<br>To increase the difficulty add the rule of only fingertips to keep the ball up, then only 1 touch per person in a <br>row so people have to work as a team.<br>If the ball touches the floor or a rule is broken the count starts again from 0.<br>First patrol to 100 wins<br>118 A Bit Of A Handful<br>The items as described within the equipment list are placed on a table/floor at the end of a room opposite the <br>associated team.(each team must have the same items in each pile)<br>On the word go, the first member of the team walks briskly/runs to the table and selects the first item of <br>equipment, picks it up and returns to his team, passes it on to the next person who goes to the table and <br>collects a second item of equipment and returns with both pieces to his team, passes it on to the third <br>person.....and so on.<br>The team who gets all of the equipment from the table to the team wins.<br>The idea is that they should collect the item which will carry most equipment, ie the box, first, and place the <br>rest of the equipment in it - and leave the heaviest item till last....they usually don't do this.<br>If they drop anything they must stop, pick it up and continue on.<br>It may be made more complicated by placing obstacles in the path for them to negotiate but safety is <br>paramount - obstacles should only be used for the older sections.<br>Idea of things to place on table i.e. wellingtons(1 off), coat, hat, scarf, magazine, rope, ball, bowl, bamboo cane <br>- (anything in the hut is ideal but each team must have the same)<br>119. Caterpillar Relay<br>The first scout runs up the hall and back, he then puts his arm between his legs and grabs the 2nd scouts hand, <br>they then run up the hall and back.<br>Each scout joins the chain until the whole Patrol are linked.<br>First patrol to finish wins<br>120. Three Chair Relay<br>1. The first two Scouts have to get up the length of the hall and back using the 3 chairs.<br>2. All members of the Patrol must go up and back at least once.<br>3. Scouts must not touch the floor, nor move a chair whilst standing on it (no bouncing!!!.)<br>From here on is a games selection of my own divided into different Categories for ease of selection<br>IDEAS AND TIPS <br>This is just a list of some ideas to help in the organisation and running of the games. <br>Sin Bin <br>It is often a problem in games where the people who are out lose interest in the game and start to mess <br>about. The Sin Bin gets over this problem very nicely. Somewhere in the hall you put six chairs in a line, <br>this is the Sin Bin. As each person is out they go and sit in the first vacant chair in the line. When the line <br>of chairs is filled up, the next person out changes places with the first person who was out who then goes <br>back into the game. This can be continued for as long as the games last and keeps the boys interested in <br>the games. <br>How To Get Equal Size/Weight Teams <br>In many games where there are two teams, it is a good idea if opponents are similar sizes. An easy way of <br>achieving this is given below: Get all the lads to line up at one side of the hall, tallest at the left shortest to <br>the right. Tell the lads to count off in twos down the line. Get all the number two's to take two steps <br>forward. You now have two teams, get each team to count off left to right 1 to N. Tell team 2 to walk in a <br>line anticlockwise around the hall until they are lined up along the opposite wall of the hall. You will now <br>have two teams of boys where each number on one team has an opponent on the other team of a similar <br>size. Another advantage of this system is that if lads have to race to the centre, they will have an equal <br>distance to run. <br>Motion Detectors <br>It is often useful to know when an object has been moved beyond a certain amount or with what severity <br>it has been moved. There are many ways of doing this some of these are listed below: <br>• An oblong tobacco tin with a layer of paper punch chads sprinkled in the bottom. A thin layer of <br>something sticky such as syrup is smeared on the underside of the lid and the lid placed on the tin. If the <br>tin is tipped over or subjected to violent movements, some of the bits of papers will stick to the lid. <br>Penalty points may then be deducted for the number of chads that are stuck to the lid of the tin. <br>• A number of small ball bearings on a dish inside a box. Any slight movement will cause the balls <br>to move. Severe movements will cause the balls to roll off the dish. Penalty points are taken off for every <br>ball off the dish. <br>• When laying out obstacle courses or minefields, it is nice to have trip lines that will operate <br>switches to set off lamps, buzzers etc. A simple but effective switch for this can be made from a spring <br>loaded wooden clothes peg. A metal drawing pin or thumb tack is pushed into the inside of each jaw and <br>a wire is connected to each one. The heads of the drawing pins are the switch contacts. A piece of card <br>connected to your trip line is pushed between the contacts to open the switch. When a player snags your <br>trip line, the card is pulled from the jaws of the clothes peg and the circuit is made. How you fix the <br>clothes pegs is left for you to decide. <br>Pressure Pad <br>What devious people we leaders are, but isn't it fun. How about pressure pad switches to put on the floor <br>which will switch on a circuit when stepped on. You can make these very easily and can throw them away <br>when the game is finished. All you need is two sheets of aluminium foil about the size of a standard sheet <br>of paper for each switch and some paper or plastic drinking straws. The aluminium foil should be as flat <br>as possible. Connect a wire to each sheet using a small crocodile clip or paper clip. Lay one sheet on the <br>ground where it is likely to be stepped on. On top of this lay some drinking straws, these are to keep the <br>two sheets apart. Lay the second sheet on top of the straws. Wires can be taped to the floor or covered <br>with carpet. [Connect the wires to a battery and small light bulb. when the sheets of aluminum foil touch <br>each other, the bulb should light up.] <br>Emergency Games Box <br>Over the years this will prove to be a real blessing.. Listed below is a list of items that you could put <br>together to make an emergency games box. <br>• A large bag of elastic bands (rubber bands). <br>• Boxes of chalk, white and coloured. <br>• 4 candles or night lights, 1 per patrol. <br>• Boxes of safety matches. <br>• A miniature cricket bat, wicket and small soft ball for indoor cricket. <br>• Ball point pens. <br>• Markers or felt tip pens. <br>• Short lengths of soft white rope with the ends whipped for knotting games. <br>• Assorted balloons. <br>• Pipe cleaners. <br>• A reel of cotton for making trip lines for minefields. <br>• Roll of sticky tape. <br>• BluTak or similar for sticking things to walls. <br>• A couple of large dice. <br>• Blank cards or small sheets of paper for writing instructions. <br>• Box of thumb tacks or drawing pins. <br>• A small torch (flashlight) with spare bulb and rechargeable batteries. <br>• 4 small pairs of scissors. <br>• A pack of playing cards. <br>• A packet of AlkaSeltzer tablets or similar. <br>• Various whistles and noise makers. <br>• Paper clips <br>• Safety pins <br>• 4 triangular bandages <br>• 4 orange plastic 'Track cones' (highway departments also use these) <br>• Cloth strips in 3 colours strips (each) are 3 inches wide and 18 inches long (great for arm bands or <br>blindfolds) strips are 6 inches wide, with an overhand knot in the middle (great for 'Bacon', or 'Capture' <br>flags) <br>Giving Out Instructions <br>You will find that prior to starting a game, it will help if you get the lads to sit down when giving the <br>instructions on how the game is to be played. This ensures that they are not walking about or looking <br>somewhere else, so they are more likely to be listening to what you are saying. <br>Leaders Are Fragile <br>Please try not to get involved with actually playing the games. Although we as leaders are probably a lot <br>bigger than the lads, we are also more fragile. By this I don't mean that we are all a load of old codgers, <br>but we don't heal as quickly and our bones are more brittle. TAKE CARE!!!!! <br>NOPREPARATION GAMES <br>The games in this chapter are all really easy to set up. Many of them needing no equipment others <br>requiring equipment which you are likely to have at hand. <br>121. Ankle Grasp <br>Gear Required = Chalk <br>Draw a ring 6' in diameter. The contestants enter the ring, stoop over and grasp their ankles. The object of <br>the game is to push your opponent over or to make him let go of his ankles. The player is automatically <br>disqualified if he steps out of the circle.<br>122. Australian Circle Game <br>Gear Required = 2 Tennis balls <br>A player stands in the centre of a circle, holding a tennis ball. He tries to throw this ball to someone in the <br>circle who will drop it. Another ball is also being passed around the circle from one boy to another. The <br>player in the centre may throw his ball to anyone, but he usually throws it to the boy about to receive the <br>ball being passed around the circle. If either ball is dropped, the one who dropped it changes places with <br>the boy in the centre. <br>123.Blind man's Knot <br>Gear Required = A rope per player, A blindfold per player <br>The squad is blindfolded. The leader passes down the line, holding a piece of cord knotted in one of the <br>familiar knots. Each boy may finger it for ten seconds to discover which knot it is. The squad is then <br>provided with a cord. At the word \"Go\" each blind player makes the knot he considers the right one. The <br>quickest (if correct) wins. <br>124. Bomb the Bridges <br>Gear Required = 24 tennis balls <br>The players stand scattered around the hall with their legs around 2 feet apart. Each player's legs form a <br>'bridge' which may be bombed. To bomb a bridge, a tennis ball must be thrown between the player's legs <br>(hitting a player's legs is not enough). Once bombed the player is out and must sit down. However, they <br>may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to bomb other players. The last player standing <br>is the winner. To prevent being bombed a player may protect himself using his hands to catch or deflect <br>the tennis ball. Players may not move their feet or crouch to prevent being 'hit'. Balls which are out of <br>reach may be retrieved quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of <br>balls the harder and faster the game becomes. <br>125. Capture The Fort <br>Gear Required = 1 Soccer ball <br>Divide players into two sides: Attackers and Defenders. Defenders form a circle, holding hands and <br>facing outward, with their captain in the centre. Attackers surround the fort at about eight or ten paces <br>distant. They try to kick a soccer ball into the fort; it may go through the legs of the defenders or over <br>their heads. If it goes over their heads, the captain may catch it and throw it out. But if it touches the <br>ground inside the circle, the fort is captured and the players change sides. <br>126. Cat and Mouse <br>Gear Required = None <br>Organise the players into a rectangular grid, or maze, spaced so that they stand two arms lengths away <br>from their partners in all 4 directions. If you have an awkward number of players you may leave out up to <br>2 players they will be given roles later in the game. Before the game starts it is best to rehearse changing <br>the maze: Start with all the players facing in the same direction with their arms spread to their sides this <br>should create a number of rows. On the command 'Turn' everyone should turn round 90° don't be too <br>worried which way just as long as it is a quarter turn. This changes the maze from rows to columns. Two <br>players a 'cat' and a 'mouse' will run around the maze, the cat trying to catch and tag the mouse. They may <br>run around the maze and along the lines of arms but must not pass or stretch across them. You can shout <br>'Turn' at any point during the game to change the maze. Thus you may suddenly prevent the mouse <br>getting caught or put the mouse very close to the cat. When the mouse is caught start again with another <br>pair or start with a new mouse and allow the old mouse to 'grow' to a cat. <br>127. Chinese Ladders <br>Gear Required = None <br>This games only belongs here insofar as the boys are likely already arranged in the right format to play it. <br>The should sit down the length of the hall facing their partners, with their feet touching those of their <br>partners....like so. Starting at the top end of the diagram, upon command, the boys jump up, and run down <br>the hall over the legs of their team (who may not move those legs!) and then touch the end of the hall. <br>They run back around the outside, touch the top wall, and then make their way over any legs back to their <br>place, whence the next boy may do the same. It's a race. Note the way I have described it so that each boy <br>must sit down beyond the next person in his team; this helps prevent cheating by starting early. This game <br>can be made more interesting by providing simple obstacles around the two outside edges of the hall, eg <br>car tyres to get through, turned gym benches to walk along, or chairs to go under. <br>128. City, Town, Country <br>Gear Required = None <br>Players sit in two lines team A and Team B, each line numbered 1 to N. Player 1 in team A says to player <br>number 1 in team B the name of a city, town or Country. We will suppose for example that he says <br>'GERMANY\". Player 1 in team B must now say a town city or country, beginning with the last letter of <br>Germany. Let us suppose that he says \"YORK\". Player 2 in team A now has to say a city, town or country <br>beginning with the letter K. This goes on all the way down the line. If a player fails to give a correct <br>answer or duplicates a previous answer, then a point is awarded to the other team. When the end of the <br>line is reached play begins at player number 1 again. <br>129. Compass Game <br>Gear Required = None <br>A game I used to play in scouts was the compass game. Everyone stood spread out around the room and <br>was told to orient themselves to 'north'. North could be real north or a convenient wall or corner in the <br>room. Everyone except for the caller and the referees closed their eyes (blindfolded if you don't think the <br>honor system will work). The caller then calls out a direction, like 'east' and then everyone turns (eyes still <br>closed) and points in the direction of east. The referee the goes around and taps the shoulder of anyone <br>not pointing in the right direction. They are out. The game continues until one player is left. It gets <br>interesting when you start calling headings and bearings.This is a good game as it only discriminates by <br>your sense of direction, which improves as you play. <br>130. Compass Points <br>Gear Required = 8/16 Poles or a piece of chalk <br>This game will be found excellent practice in learning the points of the compass. Eight staves are <br>arranged in star fashion on the ground all radiating from the center. One staff should point due North. One <br>Scout now takes up his position at the outer end of each staff, and represents one of the eight principal <br>points of the compass. The Scoutmaster now calls out any two points, such as S.E. and N., and the two <br>Scouts concerned must immediately change places. Any one moving out of place without his point being <br>named, or moving to a wrong place or even hesitating, should lose a mark. When changing places, Scouts <br>must not cross the staves, but must go outside the circle of players. when three marks have been lost the <br>Scout should fall out. As the game goes on blank spaces will occur. These will make it slightly more <br>difficult for the remaining boys. To make the game more difficult sixteen points may be used instead of <br>eight. When played indoors the lines of the compass may be drawn in chalk on the floor. <br>131. Crabs, Crows and Cranes <br>Gear Required = None <br>This is a running about game which is good if you are in a large hall or outside with a lot of boys. Split <br>them into two teams, in two lines across the hall. There should be a gap of a few feet between them. Near <br>each end of the hall should be a home line. One team are the crows, the other the cranes.If you shout <br>cranes, the cranes team must run to their home line without getting tagged by the crows team. Any <br>member of the cranes that gets tagged has to join the crows team. If you shout crows, the crows team has <br>to run to their home line without getting tagged by the cranes team. Any member of the crows that gets <br>tagged has to join the cranes team.If you shout crabs they must all stand still. Anyone that moves must <br>join the opposing team. You start off each time with both teams lined up across the hall facing each other. <br>The game ends when one team has all the players. You can have a lot of fun rolling your RRRRR'S with <br>this. CRRRRRRRRABS, CRRRRRRROWS, CRRRRRRANES. <br>132. Crab Football <br>Gear Required = 1 ball •4 chairs <br>This is a version of football which can be played indoors using chairs as goal posts. The rules are much <br>the same as normal football with the exception that players must be in the crab position. That is on hands <br>and feet with back towards the ground. You may like to make additional rules to prevent the goal keeper <br>throwing the ball too far across the hall. For example, the ball must bounce at least once on their side of <br>the hall. <br>133. Distance Clove Hitch <br>Gear Required = Long Rope, Tree/Pole Twine or Maker <br>Using a very long rope and either a tree or a pole, the object of this game is to tie a clove hitch around the <br>tree (pole) without getting near the tree. Draw a circle around the object that the knot is to be tied to and <br>tell the boys that they must not go inside that circle. The knot can be tied, but only through the co\u0002operation and teamwork of the two boys. (Hint: One boy is a runner and the other stands in one spot.) We <br>did this at a Loggers Day for the Boy Scouts and it was as much, if not more fun for the adults to try it as <br>it was for the boys. It's not anywhere as easy as it sounds <br>134. Dodge Ball <br>Gear Required = 1 ball <br>Divide boys into two teams. One team makes a circle and the other team stands inside it. The boys forming <br>the circle throw a large ball at the boys inside the circle, who are running around trying not to be hit. The <br>inside boys may not catch the ball. A ball hitting a boy on the head does not count. Only boys in the outside <br>circle may catch and throw the ball. Boys who are hit below the knee join the outside circle and try to hit <br>the inside boys. <br>Refinement: <br>Enter a six or patrol into the centre of the circle and time how long a team can stay in for. Passing the ball <br>across the circle will help catch out the more agile players! <br>135. Dog And Possum <br>Gear Required = 2 different bean bags <br>The Cubs form a circle. The Leader takes one bean bag (possum) which he starts on it way round the circle. <br>A moment later he starts the other bean bag (dog). The dog must catch the possum before it reaches the <br>starting point. <br>136. Exhaustion <br>Gear Required = None <br>The pack or troop sits in a circle and are numbered in 4's (ie 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4... ). When a player's number is <br>called he must stand up and run around the circle clockwise trying to catch and tag the player in front. When <br>tagged a player must return to his seat. The cub who is finally left wins. You may need to terminate the <br>round if two of the cubs are too evenly matched. <br>137. Head, Catch <br>Gear Required = 1 ball <br>A leader stands in a circle of boys and throws a ball to each boy in turn. When the ball is thrown the <br>leader shouts 'head' or 'catch' the boy must do the opposite. When a boy makes too many mistakes he is <br>out. The boy does not necessarily need to head the ball successfully an attempt is usually enough. Similar <br>to previous game but faster reactions are required. <br>138. Hide &amp; Seek <br>Gear Required = None <br>We turn all the lights off in the entire church (including those intended to be left on permanently). One <br>scout stays in the meeting room and counts to twenty, the rest of the scouts hide anywhere (except for preset <br>off limits areas) in the building. \"It\" begins looking for the scouts. Once a scout is found, he joins \"it\" in <br>the hunt. The last scout found is the winner. The scouts especially enjoy jumping out of a dark corner and <br>scaring their scoutmaster. <br>139. Hop Knot <br>Gear Required = 1 Knotting rope <br>All the Cubs sit in a circle. With the exception of one who has the rope. On \"go\" he drops the rope at the <br>feet of one of the players, at the same time calling out the name of a knot. He then commences to hop round <br>the circle, while the knot is being tied. If tied correctly the tier becomes the hopper. <br>140.Hot Potato <br>Gear Required = 1 Handkerchief <br>A scout is chosen as the IT. He stands in the center, while the others sit in a circle. The players toss a <br>handkerchief to one another; making many false moves and gestures. The IT must touch the handkerchief <br>while in the air. If he does so, the last to throw becomes IT. The passing cannot be delayed. <br>142. In The Pond <br>Gear Required = Chalk <br>Mark a big circle on the floor. This is the pond. The whole group stands around the edge. The leader is the <br>referee. When he shouts \"In the Pond,\" you all jump into the circle. When he shouts \"On the Bank,\" you all <br>jump out. But. sometimes he will try and trick you by saying \"On the Pond\" or \"In the Bank.\" When he <br>does this, nobody should obey. Anyone who moves, on a wrong order, is out of the game or may pay a <br>forfeit and get back in. <br>143. Kill The Rattlesnake <br>Gear Required = 1 blindfold •1 rolled newspaper or stuffed hiking sock <br>This is a similar game to 'Whomp'em'. Jehosophat, the naughty slave, is nominated and must stand within <br>the circle of players. Another player is the blindfolded master. The master calls: 'Jehosophat! Jehosophat!' <br>and of course Jehosophat must reply: 'Yes Master, Yes Master' allowing the master to find him and hit him <br>with his stuffed hiking sock or newspaper. Jehosophat may move within the circle to avoid his master but <br>doing so may create enough noise for the master to find him.After the master has managed to find <br>Jehosophat (or after 2 minutes) a new Jehosophat is nominated and the old Jehosophat becomes the master. <br>Variation: <br>The hunter calls 'Rattlesnake' and the rattle snake replies by jangling keys or a tin with pebbles in it. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>At 1st &amp; 7th Frome Jubilee Scout Group, we believe in preparing young people with skills for life. We encourage our young people to do more, learn more and be more.</p>\n<p>Each week, we provide young people the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future. We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</p>\n<p>We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance, always. We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</p>\n<p>By 2023 we will have prepared more young people with skills for life, supported by amazing leaders delivering an inspiring programme. We will be growing, more inclusive, shaped by young people and making a bigger impact in our communities.</p>\n<p>We are proud to say we are a values-based movement. Our Scout values of integrity, respect, care, belief and cooperation guide everything we do.</p>\n<h4>Scouts prepare young people for Skills For Life</h4>\n<p>Each week Scouts gives almost half a million people aged 6-25 the skills they need for school, college, university, the job interview, the important speech, the tricky challenge and the big dreams: the skills they need for life.</p>\n<p>We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience &amp; skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s welcome here. All genders, races and backgrounds. Regardless of your child’s physical ability – there’s a Scout adventure out there waiting for them. And we’ll help them find it.</p>\n<p>We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</p>\n<h4>What do Scouts do?  </h4>\n<p>Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling, cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week – having fun, playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.</p>\n<h4>Volunteers</h4>\n<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, from helping out occasionally on a parent rota or volunteering your time as a leader to supporting local Scouting. Our volunteering opportunities are as varied as you! Because whether you’re helping a leader to run an activity in the local village hall, organising a night away, or buttering 120 slices of bread for a group of very hungry eleven year olds - no two Scout meetings are the same. The difference you make, though, is always great.</p>\n<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>",
