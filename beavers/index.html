Beaver scouts enjoy making friends, gaining badges, playing games, going on local visits, helping others, exploring the outdoors, having the opportunity to be creative, and experience the excitement of a beaver sleepover with their friends.</p><p>Beavers achieve everything they set their minds to and have lots of fun along the way!</p><p>We are looking for new adult volunteers to be able to do this! Are you looking for a fun and exciting challenge? Or do you know someone who could help?</p><p>Volunteer as much or as little as you’re able, our Scouting team are all equally as important. We need your support to open.</p><p>Contact <a href="mailto:beaver@1stand7thfromescouts.org.uk">beaver@1stand7thfromescouts.org.uk</a></p><p>Interested in joining your young person to our Waiting List, for any section?
