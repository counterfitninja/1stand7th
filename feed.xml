            <![CDATA[
                <p>At 1st &amp; 7th Frome Jubilee Scout Group, we believe in preparing young people with skills for life. We encourage our young people to do more, learn more and be more.</p>
<p>Each week, we provide young people the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future. We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</p>
<p>We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance, always. We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</p>
<p>By 2023 we will have prepared more young people with skills for life, supported by amazing leaders delivering an inspiring programme. We will be growing, more inclusive, shaped by young people and making a bigger impact in our communities.</p>
<p>We are proud to say we are a values-based movement. Our Scout values of integrity, respect, care, belief and cooperation guide everything we do.</p>
<h4>Scouts prepare young people for Skills For Life</h4>
<p>Each week Scouts gives almost half a million people aged 6-25 the skills they need for school, college, university, the job interview, the important speech, the tricky challenge and the big dreams: the skills they need for life.</p>
<p>We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience &amp; skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</p>
<p>Everyone’s welcome here. All genders, races and backgrounds. Regardless of your child’s physical ability – there’s a Scout adventure out there waiting for them. And we’ll help them find it.</p>
<p>We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</p>
<h4>What do Scouts do?  </h4>
<p>Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling, cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week – having fun, playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.</p>
<h4>Volunteers</h4>
<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, from helping out occasionally on a parent rota or volunteering your time as a leader to supporting local Scouting. Our volunteering opportunities are as varied as you! Because whether you’re helping a leader to run an activity in the local village hall, organising a night away, or buttering 120 slices of bread for a group of very hungry eleven year olds - no two Scout meetings are the same. The difference you make, though, is always great.</p>
<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>

<p>Cubs are young people aged 8 to 10½ who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master new skills and try new things</li>
<li>Have fun and go on adventures</li>
<li>Make friends</li>
<li>Are curious about the world around them</li>
<li>Help others and make a difference, in their own communities and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>Every week, they gather in groups called <strong>Cub Packs</strong> to take part in lots of interesting and challenging activities – achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Going on adventures</strong></p>
<p>Race down a river. Tell stories by torchlight. Fall asleep beneath the stars. Alongside your Pack, you’ll spend plenty of time in the great outdoors. Together, you might build a den in your local park, or create an edible raft out of sweets, or go on a moonlit hike through your hometown.</p>
<p><strong>Learning new skills</strong></p>
<p>Cubs learn by doing, and so will you. Some of the skills you develop will be practical, like knowing how to cook a delicious meal or give someone first aid.</p>
<p><strong>Helping others</strong></p>
<p>Cubs work as a team to help other people. Together, you’ll learn about global issues and what we can all do to help solve them.</p>

<p>Cubs are young people aged 8 to 10½ who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master new skills and try new things</li>
<li>Have fun and go on adventures</li>
<li>Make friends</li>
<li>Are curious about the world around them</li>
<li>Help others and make a difference, in their own communities and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>Every week, they gather in groups called <strong>Cub Packs</strong> to take part in lots of interesting and challenging activities – achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way.</p>
