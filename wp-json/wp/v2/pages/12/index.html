Beaver scouts enjoy making friends, gaining badges, playing games, going on local visits,&nbsp;helping others, exploring the outdoors, having the opportunity to be creative, and experience the excitement of a beaver sleepover with their friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beavers achieve everything they set their minds to and have lots of fun along the way!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking for new adult volunteers to be able to do this! Are you looking for a fun and exciting challenge? Or do you know someone who could help?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteer as much or as little as you\u2019re able, our Scouting team are all equally as important.
